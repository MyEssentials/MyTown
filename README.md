A continuation of alphaest's MyTown mod for minecraft, http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1650110-146-151mytown-aperf-server-protection-and-performance-mods/.

Land protection mod. Create new towns, add members to it, set up personalised plots, configure plot/town permissions.

Features
* Towns - Don't be a loner. Play together by building small or big towns!
* Nations - Join nations to build your towns next to eachother and chat more easily
* Town teleporting - Don't force your new recruits to walk, let them get to your town quick
* Residents, assistants, mayors - Towny-like hierarchical schema
* HeroChat like chat, town/nation channel - /ch tc - /g Hello! - /l Kle ära nussi - [TR][Mod]supercool[<3]: Buying iridium plates!
* Tight protection - Protects against most mod world changing items like IC mininglaser, BC quarrys, TC excavationwand etc. Tailored for FTB MindCrack modpack.
* Permissions - Claim only half plots for your roads so the one claiming next to it can use the other parts of the plot. Disable outsiders entering a plot or just cant loot or can access but cant build. Disable/enable quarries to make your plots safe against this old devil. And much more. Check it out using /t perm plot.
